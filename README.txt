You can run this exe from Command Windows by:

Going where the CoinListener.exe is being stored, for example; "cd C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\CoinListenerFile"

After going to where the exe is being stored, once again you can run CoinListener.exe by using a command like "CoinListener.exe BTCUSDT 10000 30000 50" and start listening to BTCUSDT price. 

The first paramater "BTCUSDT" is the coin pair's name. "10000" is the lower price limit, if the token's price goes lower than this the exe will by the coin by the ammonut that you decided. "30000" is the higher price limit, works just like the "lower price limit" but this time exe will buy the coin if the token's price goes above this limit. The last parameter "50" is the   amount of USDT that you will spend to by BTC.

If the price is inbetween these limits exe will keep listening to the coin pairs price untill it reaches one of those limits.
